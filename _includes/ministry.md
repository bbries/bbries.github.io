# Ministry Overview
## History
After 2 years of training and missions in South America through Youth With A Mission, the Lord has called me to do ministry in the USA. In my time in South America I learned Spanish and Portuguese and completed a bible school, setting me up for the assignment I am carrying out at the Youth With A Mission base in Chico, California.
## Vision
The church of the western world, specifically the United States and Europe, is ripe for revival. The current cores of Christianity in the world are in what were considered missionary-*receiving* nations just 100 years ago. These nations are now taking the lead in missionary-*sending*, but not without difficulty. The next outpouring of revival in the western church, and indeed the church throughout the world, is eagerly awaiting the arrival of this new wave of missionaries. I stand in a unique position to mobilize this generation of missionaries from the nations of Latinoamerica into the whole world.
## Current plans and direction
The Lord has called me to the Youth With A Mission base in Chico, California. For the next couple of years I will work as staff on the base. I currently work in their **mobilization** department. This means making contact with people who have expressed interest in YWAM's Discipleship Training School or other training opportunities through our base, praying with and helping them to complete the application process to become students and staff at the Chico base. I have already been given the lead on communication with all contacts in the Latino world. I am working closely with leadership of that department and base leadership to reach out to the 50 million people of latino descent who live in the United States, as well as those who live in Latinoamerica, and offer them the training and missions opportunities of our base. 

In addition to working in the mobilization department I am involved in the areas of **worship** and **prayer** in order to steward a strong culture of encountering the lord to bring new students into. I pray that, through our efforts to target the latin world in our mobilization strategies, we will bring in several bilingual students who would eventually become base staff, at which point I will be able to begin planning a bilingual Discipleship Training School, overcoming the language barrier that most latinos have with our current english-only training programs.
