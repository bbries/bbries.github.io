# Ministry Overview
#### Awakening the Church to love the World
## Core Values
>*Core values are the attitudes of our hearts that determine how we make decisions both proactively and reactively to the circumstances around us.*

---
* **Honor** and value all people, including strangers and foreigners.
* **Presence driven:** seeking daily encounter with the Lord and constant communion with the Holy Spirit.
* **Obedience** to the Holy Spirit: When we walk in communion with Him, we must be quick to affirm in our actions every word He speaks.
* **Family:** Loving and caring for one another as family, not only referring to one another as family "in Christ," but in our actions also. (see [Philemon 16][Phil16])

## History
After 2 years of training and missions in South America through Youth With A Mission, the Lord has called me to do ministry in the USA. In my time in South America I learned Spanish and Portuguese and completed a bible school, setting me up for the assignment I am carrying out at the Youth With A Mission base in Chico, California.

## Vision
The church of the western world, specifically the United States and Europe, is ripe for revival. Revival brings new reality to our faith and new life to our world, as individuals encountering God, Love Himself, are inspired to serve, love, and honor others, transforming communities through the love of God. The current cores of Christianity are in places that a century ago were considered missionary-*receiving* nations. These nations are now taking the lead in missionary-*sending*. The current outpouring of revival in the western church, and indeed the whole global church, is eagerly awaiting the arrival of this new wave of missionaries. The Lord has placed me in a position to mobilize this generation of missionaries from the nations of Latin America into the whole world.

## Current plans and direction
The Lord has brought me to the Youth With A Mission campus in Chico, California. For the **next couple of years** I will serve as staff on our campus. I currently serve in their **mobilization** department. This means making contact with people who have expressed interest in our Discipleship Training School or other training opportunities on our campus, praying with and helping them to complete the application process to become students and staff on our campus. I have already been given the lead on communication with all contacts in the Latino world, including Hispanic people in the USA. I am working closely with my leadership to reach out to the 50 million people of latino descent who live in the United States, as well as those who live in Latin America, offering them the training and missions opportunities of Youth With A Mission. 

In addition to serving in mobilization, I am involved in the areas of **worship** and **prayer** in order to build and maintain a stronger culture of encountering the Lord on our campus and in our city. When we bring students into the process of discipleship, many for the first time, we want them to come into a culture that makes encountering the Lord in a personal way as easy as possible.

**Day to day** I will be leading worship and prayer times, communicating with potential students and staff, and serving with churches and groups in the community with the ongoing opportunity to serve the thousands of displaced people affected by the fires of November 2018.

Over the **next few months** I will be prayerfully considering working directly in one of our Discipleship Training Schools, teaching in our School of Biblical Studies, and any new opportunities the Lord brings my way to partner with churches and faith communities that hold the same hope for fresh revival in our country, among the Latino peoples, and the whole world.

I pray that, through our efforts to bring in Latino students, we will receive several bilingual students who will become staff with us, at which point I will, God-willing, start a bilingual Discipleship Training School, overcoming the language and cultural barrier that so many latinos face in reaching the nations the Lord has placed on their hearts.
