# Notes

This blog adopts the [Cayman theme][2]. Please see the [Cayman repository][1] for 
details on configuring and customizing the theme's various options.

[Various improvements for blogging in this theme][3] have been made by [pietromanna][4].


## Development direction

The originally selected theme (Cayman) really doesn't support blogs very well at all. 

[Ben Balter][7] has demonstrated the use of [jekyll-remote-theme][6] on his personal website, making use of his theme [retlab][8].

Intention:
1. [ ] Sam will fork the Cayman theme into a dedicated repo, that can be kept rebased onto upstream master.
2. [ ] This blog will be updated to reference that remote theme, by repository name, in `_config.yml`.
3. [ ] Sam will modify that remote theme, in a development branch, to suit the needs of this site.
